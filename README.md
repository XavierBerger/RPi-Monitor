### Overview

[**RPi-Monitor**](http://rpi-experiences.blogspot.fr/) is a self monitoring application designed to run on [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org).

For performance and security reason, [**RPi-Monitor**](http://rpi-experiences.blogspot.fr/) separates the extraction of the information from the presentation of the information.

The extraction of the information is done by a process designed to run as a daemon (which can be executed as root).
The extracted key performance indicators (KPI) from the computer are stored them into a Round Robin Database (RRD)
to keep an history of the health of the computer. rpimonitord is the perl script also starts the embedded web
server giving access to the pages. The web server is running into a separate process owned by a non root user
(the user 'pi' by default).

The presentation of the information is performed by HTML5 pages. These pages dynamically download the
information extracted from the previous script and perform the rendering the in a nice looking format
( using [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/), [jquery](http://jquery.com/),
[jsqrencode](https://code.google.com/p/jsqrencode/), [javascriptrrd](http://javascriptrrd.sourceforge.net/) and 
[flot](http://www.flotcharts.org/) ).

This architecture has the advantage in an embedded architecture to offload the server task and delegate
processing and rendering to the client.

Finnally note that the embedded server doesn't provide access control or authentication. It is still possible
to not start the embeded web server and use an external web server to deliver the pages.
